This is a simple Online Shop created in Visual Studio 2022, using ASP.NET framework.

All the items for the shop and blogs in web-site are stored in a local database(I use MAMP), if you want to test it, connect your DB in appsettings.json

On web-site:
  -Items page (all the items from store)
  -About Us (info about you)
  -Login/Register (just basic login/register stuff)
  -Blog (Read the other users blogs)
  -Add Blog (Create yourself a blog)
